# `acts_as_favoritor` - Add Favorites to you Rails app

<img src="https://travis-ci.org/slooob/acts_as_favoritor.svg?branch=master" />

`acts_as_favoritor` is a Rubygem to allow any ActiveRecord model to associate any other model including the option for multiple relationships per association with scopes.

You are able to differentiate followers, favorites, watchers and whatever else you can imagine through a single relationship. This is accomplished by a double polymorphic relationship on the Favorite model. There is also built in support for blocking/un-blocking favorite records.

## Installation

`acts_as_favoritor` works with Rails 4.0 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'acts_as_favoritor'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install acts_as_favoritor

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'acts_as_favoritor', github: 'slooob/acts_as_favoritor'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g acts_as_favoritor

    $ rails db:migrate

This will create a Favorite model as well as a migration file.

**Note:** Use `rake db:migrate` instead if you run Rails < 5.

## Usage

### Setup

Add `acts_as_favoritable` to the models you want to be able to get favorited:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_favoritable
end

class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_favoritable
end
```

Specify which models can favorite other models by adding `acts_as_favoritor`:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_favoritor
end
```

### `acts_as_favoritor` methods

```ruby
book = Book.find 1
user = User.find 1

# `user` favorites `book`.
user.favorite book

# `user` removes `book` from favorites.
user.remove_favorite book

# Whether `user` has marked `book` as his favorite. Returns `true` or `false`.
user.favorited? book

# Total number of favorites by `user`.
user.favorites_count

# Returnes `user`'s favorites that have not been blocked as an array of `Favorite` records.
user.all_favorites

# Returns all favorited objects of `user` as an array (unblocked). This can be a collection of different object types, eg: `User`, `Book`.
user.all_favorited

# Returns an array of `Favorite` records where the `favoritable_type` is `Book`.
user.favorites_by_type 'Book'

# Returns an array of all favorited objects of `user` where `favoritable_type` is 'Book', this can be a collection of different object types, eg: `User`, `Book`.
user.favorited_by_type 'Book'

# Returns the exact same result as `user.favorited_by_type 'User'`.
user.favorited_users

# Total number of favorited books by `user`.
user.favorited_by_type_count 'Book'

# Returns the exact same result as `user.favorited_by_type_count 'Book'`.
user.favorited_books_count

# Returns the Arel scope for favorites.
# This does not return the actual favorites, just the scope of favorited including the favoritables, essentially: `book.favorites.unblocked.includes(:favoritable)`.
book.favorites_scoped
```

These methods take an optional hash parameter of ActiveRecord options (`:limit`, `:order`, etc...)

    favorites_by_type, all_favorites, all_favorited, favorited_by_type

### `acts_as_favoritable` methods

```ruby
# Returns all favoritors of a model that `acts_as_favoritable`
book.favoritors

# Returns the Arel scope for favoritors. This does not return the actual favoritors, just the scope of favorited records including the favoritors, essentially:  `book.favorited.includes(:favoritors)`.
book.favoritors_scoped

# Total number of favoritors.
book.favoritors_count

# Returns an array of records with type `User` following `book`.
book.favoritors_by_type 'User'

# Returns the exact same as `book.favoritors_by_type 'User'`.
book.user_favoritors

# Total number of favoritors with type `User`.
book.favoritors_by_type_count 'User'

# Returns the exact same as `book.favoritors_by_type_count 'User'`.
book.count_user_favoritors

To see is a model that acts_as_followable is followed by a model that acts_as_follower use the following
# Whether `book` has been favorited by `user`. Returns `true` or `false`.
book.favorited_by? user

# Block a favoritor
book.block user

# Unblock a favoritor
book.unblock user

# Returns an array including all blocked Favoritor records.
book.blocks

# Total number of `book`'s favoritors blocked.
book.blocked_favoritors_count
```

These methods take an optional hash parameter of ActiveRecord options (`:limit`, `:order`, etc...)

    favoritors_by_type, favoritors, blocks

### `Favorite` model

```ruby
# Scopes
## Returns all `Favorite` records where `blocked` is `false`.
Favorite.unblocked
## Returns all `Favorite` records where `blocked` is `true`.
Favorite.blocked
## Returns an ordered array of the latest create `Favorite` records.
Favorite.descending

# Returns all `Favorite` records in an array, which have been created in a specified timeframe. Default is 2 weeks.
Favorite.recent
Favorite.recent 1.month.ago

# Returns all favorites of `user`, including those who were blocked.
Favorite.for_favoritor user

# Returns all favoritors of `book`, including those who were blocked.
Favorite.for_favoritable book
```

### Scopes

Using scopes with `acts_as_favoritor` enables you to Follow, Watch, Favorite, [...] between any of your models. This way you can separate distinct functionalities in your app between user states. For example: A user sees all his favorited books in a dashboard (`'favorites'`), but he only receives notifications for those, he is watching (`'watching'`). Just like YouTube does it.

By default all of your favorites are scoped to `'favorites'`.

You can create new scopes on the fly. Every single method takes `scope` as an option which expexts an array containing your scopes as strings.

So lets see how this works:

```ruby
user.favorite book, scope: [:favorites, :watching]
user.remove_favorite book, scope: [:watching]
book.block user, scope: [:all] # applies to all scopes
```

That's simple!

When you call a method which returns something while specifying multiple scopes, the method returns the results in a hash with the scopes as keys:

```ruby
user.favorited? book, scope: [:favorites, :watching] # => { favorites: true, watching: false }
user.favorited? book, scope: [:all] # => true
```

`acts_as_favoritor` also provides some handy scopes for you to call on the `Favorite` model:

```ruby
# Returns all `Favorite` records where `scope` is `my_scope`
Favorite.send(my_scope + '_list')

## Examples
### Returns all `Favorite` records where `scope` is `favorites`
Favorite.favorites_list
### Returns all `Favorite` records where `scope` is `watching`
Favorite.watching_list
### Very unnecessary, but `all_list` returns literally all `Favorite` records
Favorite.all_list
```
